## Commands

### `/full-review`

Orchestrate comprehensive multi-dimensional code review using all specialized review agents.

```
/full-review src/features/auth/ --security-focus
```

**Options:**
| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--security-focus` | Prioritize security analysis |
| `--performance-critical` | Deep performance review |
| `--strict-mode` | Strictest quality standards |
| `--framework react\|django` | Framework-specific checks |

---

### `/senior-review`

Unified code review -- auto-detects scope: uncommitted/staged changes, recent commits, PR number, or branch diff. Runs architecture, security, and pattern analysis agents in parallel with confidence scoring.

```
/senior-review                    # auto-detect: uncommitted changes or branch diff
/senior-review 42                 # review PR #42
/senior-review --commits 3        # review last 3 commits
/senior-review --branch feature   # review branch diff
/senior-review --auto-comment     # post findings as PR comments
```

---

### `/pr-enhance`

Analyze current branch changes, generate comprehensive PR description with risk assessment and review checklist, and optionally create the PR via `gh`.

```
/pr-enhance --create
```
