# Anvil Hooks Plugin

> Session lifecycle hooks for the anvil-toolset ecosystem -- startup branding, skill awareness, security enforcement, automatic context management, brainstorm gating, and code review gating.

**Note:** This plugin uses `plugin.json` for hook configuration instead of marketplace registration. Hooks run automatically -- no manual invocation needed.

## Hooks

### SessionStart hooks

These run automatically when a Claude Code session starts:

| Handler | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `anvil-logo.js` | Displays ASCII logo on session startup |
| `skill-awareness.js` | Injects skill awareness so Claude knows which skills are available |
| `cleanup-builtins.js` | Removes duplicate built-in plugins that conflict with anvil-toolset |

### UserPromptSubmit hooks

These run before Claude processes a user prompt:

| Handler | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `brainstorm-gate.js` | Detects creative/building intent (add, create, build, implement, etc.) and reminds Claude to invoke brainstorming + worktree-manager skills before jumping into code |

**Bypass conditions:** slash commands, questions (ending with `?`), single-word prompts, bug fix/debug prompts, prompts starting with `*` (explicit bypass).

### PreToolUse hooks

These run before specific tool invocations:

| Handler | Matcher | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `review-gate.js` | `Bash` | Blocks `gh pr create` and `git merge` targeting main/master until `/code-review` is run |

**Bypass conditions:**
- Set `reviewGate` to `false` in `~/.claude/anvil-config.json`
- Add `--no-review` flag to the command
- Merging FROM main/master into a feature branch (pulling in upstream changes is fine)

### PostToolUse hooks

These run after specific tool invocations:

| Handler | Trigger | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `security-gate.js` | After `Write` or `Edit` | Scans written/edited files for hardcoded secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) and blocks commits |
| `autocompact.js` | After any tool use | Monitors context usage and triggers automatic compaction when context is high |

## Configuration

`plugins/anvil-hooks/hooks/hooks.json` defines the hooks. Handler scripts live in `plugins/anvil-hooks/hooks/handlers/`.

**Disablable hooks** (via `~/.claude/anvil-config.json`):
- `securityGate: false` - disable secret scanning
- `reviewGate: false` - disable PR/merge review gating

**Optional dependencies:** `ai-tooling` (skill awareness injection), `git-worktrees` (brainstorm-gate worktree awareness), `senior-review` (review-gate `/code-review` command).
