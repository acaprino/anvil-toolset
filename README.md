Plugin set for [Anvil](https://github.com/acaprino/anvil). 32 ready-to-install plugins for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) -- an AI coding CLI by Anthropic. Specialized agents, skills, and commands for Python, senior review, frontend, Tauri/Rust, AI tooling, Obsidian, RAG systems, and more -- so you spend less time prompting and more time shipping.

**32 plugins | 35 agents | 48 skills | 38 commands** -- install only what you need.

---

## Why Use These Plugins?

- **Specialized agents outperform generic prompts** -- each plugin encodes domain expertise developed over months
- **Multi-agent orchestration** -- code review fires architecture, security, and pattern analysis in parallel
- **Cross-plugin workflows** -- chain brainstorming, planning, implementation, review, and cleanup into single commands
- **Install only what you need** -- each plugin is independent with no runtime dependencies
- **Community-driven and open source** -- MIT licensed, contributions welcome

| Type | What it is | How to use |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Agent** | A specialized AI persona with domain expertise | `Use the python-pro agent to implement rate limiting` |
| **Skill** | A knowledge module that enhances Claude's capabilities | Claude references it automatically when relevant |
| **Command** | A slash command that triggers a specific workflow | `/senior-review`, `/python-scaffold`, `/feature-e2e` |
