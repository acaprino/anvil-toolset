# NOTICE

This `frontend` plugin vendors portions of work from multiple upstream projects.
Per Apache-2.0 4(d) and MIT attribution practice, the originating NOTICE content
and license information is preserved below.

default branch. See `CLAUDE.md` (root of this repo) for the per-file sync table
that maps each derived file back to its upstream source.

> The `typography.md` reference in this project incorporates a set of tactical additions merged in from ehmo's `typecraft-guide-skill` at the author's request: dark-mode weight/tracking compensation, `font-display: optional` vs `swap`, preload-critical-weight-only guidance, variable fonts for 3+ weights, `clamp()` max-to-min ratio bound, responsive measure/container coupling, `text-wrap: balance` / `pretty`, `font-optical-sizing: auto`, ALL-CAPS tracking quantification, and the paragraph-rhythm rule (space OR indent, never both).

### Local impact of this NOTICE

The Anthropic `frontend-design` lineage applies to all Impeccable-derived files
listed in the sync table: the 7 reference files (typography, color-and-contrast,
motion-design, heuristics-scoring, cognitive-load, personas, brand-register)
plus the 4 appended sections inside `layout-patterns.md`, `ui-pattern-guide.md`,
`css-patterns.md`, and `ux-patterns.md`.

The `ehmo/typecraft-guide-skill` lineage applies specifically to
`plugins/frontend/skills/frontend-css/references/typography.md`. Its attribution
header credits both Impeccable (the immediate upstream we vendored from) and
ehmo (the original author of the typography additions Impeccable merged in).
